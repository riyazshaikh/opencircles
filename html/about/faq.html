	<h3>What is Open Circles?</h3>
	<div>Open Circles is a unique way to discover fun activities &amp; people around you. It is an endeavor to encourage people in
	New York (or anyone living in big cities), to interact more with fellow strangers and create meaningful connections.
	</div>

	<h3>Wait. Is this a dating site?</h3>
	<div>
	At Open Circles, we believe people dont meet someone new with an explicit intention of dating, friendship, networking, etc. 
	But rather, our common interests trigger these kinds of connections. And when we interact with others keeping our mind free of any intentions,
	it creates a more meaningful connection.

	<h3>Great! So how does this work?</h3>
	<div>
	In 3 easy steps:
	<ol>
		<li>Find some activity or event you like (or create your own!)</li>
		<li>Post a message asking if anyone wants to join you.</li>
		<li>We will let you know when someone comes looking for the same activity.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Umm, what about safety?</h3>
	<div>
	There are a number of ways we address safety concerns:
	<ol>
		<li>Social profiles are encouraged when posting messages, so that people can know more about who they're meeting.</li>
		<li>Users are encouraged to communicate through us, so that we can let them know if something sounds fishy.</li>
		<li>And finally, the most basic rule for safety - we encourage everyone to meet in a public place.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

	<h3>Sounds too good to be free. Whats the catch?</h3>
	<div>
	The best things in life are free! Open Circles is free to use, and has no hidden cost (or spam for that matter). And it will remain
	so until I run out of money. But nonetheless, if you want to contribute in any way to this project, do contact us - opencircles@open-circles.org.
