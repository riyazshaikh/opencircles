	<h3><a href="#">What is Open Circles?</a></h3>
	<div>Open Circles is a unique way to discover fun activities &amp; people around you. Think of it as a social network for your local neighborhood!
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#">Great! So how does this work?</a></h3>
	<div>
	In 3 easy steps:
	<ol>
		<li>Think of some activity you like.</li>
		<li>Post message asking if anyone wants to get together for it.</li>
		<li>Someone interested in the same activity sees your message, and contacts you.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

	<h3><a href="#">What makes OpenCirclez different from the other event finder apps?</a></h3>
	<div>
	On the surface, OpenCirclez feels like a regular event finder app. But a lot goes on underneath to make this unlike any other:
	<ol>
		<li>Ubercool geolocation system, to show results in your immediate vicinity.</li>
		<li>Smaller gatherings encouraged by promoting events with fewer people attending.</li>
		<li>Activity listings aggregated live from various sources, to provide a wholesome idea of whats happening around you.</li>
		<li>User contributed activities are encouraged, by ranking them higher in the listings</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	
	<h3><a href="#">Sounds too good to be free. Whats the catch?</a></h3>
	<div>
	The best things in life are free! Open Circles is free to use, and has no hidden cost (or spam for that matter). But nonetheless, if you want to contribute in any way to this project, do contact us - admin@opencirclez.com
